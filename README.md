# Music Science ðŸŽµðŸ§ª
> Music is most typically associated with the arts. However, it can't be overlooked that there is an intersection with music and science. There's a beauty and an art when uncovering the science of music, and that's what Music Science is about!

### What Makes a Song Popular? ðŸ”¥
In this project, I hope to be doing analysis on what makes a hit song. Some questions I'll be asking are:
* Are there shared similarities based on a song's metadata (i.e. bpm, variability, etc)? 
* What motivates people to listen to these types of songs? 
* Are there specific target values for these songs that songwriters and producers aim for? 

As someone who considers music to be an important part of their life and someone who is interested in music production (though I have not dabbled in it yet), learning and analyzing trends related to music sounds like a very fun project. Researching this type of information could also help others to understand certain statistics and why they hear and potentially enjoy very similar trending and top songs. There is definitely no equation for creating a top song, but knowing the data and contextualizing it could influence the music industry.
